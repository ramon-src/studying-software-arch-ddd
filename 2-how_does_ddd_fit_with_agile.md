# How does DDD fit with Agile

## DDD works with collaboration

As we can see in the Agile Manifesto "Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project".

So the business person's notion of the way the domain work impact directly to how the system works and his architecture.

## Inspect and Adapt

DDD works very well with small increments of agile process. So small changes, delivery, feedback, improve, delivery... are the best way to make a good fit with the business.

1. Make a small change
2. Assess (feedback)
3. Inspect and adapt
4. Improve
