# WHAT IS DDD

## DDD is modeling

It means tat structure of code should be a model of the structure of the domain.

All collaborators can make sens of the structure.

And changes are made to the domain, which maps to where code changes should occur.

## DDD is incremental

DDD come up with only enough architecture to solve the immediate problem.

The code evolves as you learn more about the problem and more architecture is added, following an agile workflow.

A domain driven design architecture is designed to grow incrementally over time because the architecture itself grows incrementally over time.

## Domain influences the System and System influences Domain

It's a cyclic flow because when we have a change in the system and the users use that change or feature they can see what more they need, so changing the domain and also the system.
